## -[] 5 Ws

The 5 Ws are a set of questions that are often used in journalism and investigation to gather information about a topic. The questions are:

Who - Refers to the person or people involved in the event or situation being discussed.

What - Refers to the event or situation itself, and the actions or circumstances that took place.

When - Refers to the time and date when the event or situation occurred.

Where - Refers to the location where the event or situation occurred.

Why - Refers to the reasons behind the event or situation, and the motivations or causes that led to it.

## -[] 5 why

The "5 Whys" is a technique used in problem-solving and quality control that involves asking "why" five times in order to get to the root cause of a problem. By asking "why" repeatedly, the goal is to identify underlying issues or causes that may not be immediately apparent.

Here's an example:

Problem: A machine in a factory has stopped working.

Why did the machine stop working? - Because the motor burned out.
Why did the motor burn out? - Because it was overheating.
Why was it overheating? - Because the cooling fan wasn't working properly.
Why wasn't the cooling fan working properly? - Because it was clogged with dirt and debris.
Why was it clogged with dirt and debris? - Because the maintenance schedule for the machine wasn't being followed.
So in this example, the root cause of the problem is not the burned-out motor, but rather the failure to follow the maintenance schedule, which led to the clogged fan and the motor overheating. By identifying this root cause, the factory can take steps to prevent similar problems from occurring in the future.

## -[]5Cs

Collaboration: Refers to the ability to work effectively with others towards a common goal. This includes skills such as teamwork, compromise, and conflict resolution.

Critical Thinking: Refers to the ability to analyze information and make reasoned judgments based on evidence. This includes skills such as problem-solving, decision-making, and logical reasoning.

Character: Refers to traits such as honesty, integrity, and responsibility. This includes skills such as accountability, work ethic, and professionalism.

Creativity: Refers to the ability to think outside the box and generate new ideas. This includes skills such as innovation, imagination, and curiosity.

Communication: Refers to the ability to express ideas and information clearly and effectively. This includes skills such as active listening, public speaking, and written communication.

Developing these skills is important for success in many areas of life, including education, work, and personal relationships. By emphasizing the 5 Cs, educators and trainers aim to help individuals build well-rounded skillsets that can be applied in a variety of contexts.
